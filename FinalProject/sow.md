## Collaborative Paint, Version 2, presented by The Paint Factory


### Key Items

* Client name: The Paint Factory
* Project code name: Collaborative Paint
* Key Contacts: *Your project manager*
* Estimated Schedule: ~6 weeks

### Proposal Summary

The Paint Factory is wanting a desktop application that allows users to collaboratively paint. Something like a Google Docs for folks to collaborate on in real time. As users draw on one application, it should update in real time on all others who have joined. Thus, the application should be networked.

We at The Paint Factory value speed, so the desktop application should be programmed in modern C++. Our engineers have some experience with the SFML library, so we would also like that to be used.

### Goals and objectives of our engagement

- During the first week get organized and get the team together. Do preliminary research into tasks identifying trouble points to the above. Make project estimates and develop an overall schedule.
- Focus on completing a MVP as soon as possible and checking in with project manager intermitently.
- Work within team in roughly 1 to 2 week sprints to achieve objectives.
- Demo working application, record working application.


### Deliverable

- Full source code of application with agreed upon functionality
- Full CMake file that can build and run on Windows, Linux, or Mac.


### Additional Client Requirements

- Minimum of a few check-ins during normal meeting times should be done to keep project manager and client up to speed.

We look forward to doing business with you.
