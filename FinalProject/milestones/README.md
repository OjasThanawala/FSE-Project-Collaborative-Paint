# Milestones

Each milestone represents a task or perhaps an entire sprint that you will need to complete for your project. The order can be completed in any order, but note there are a few hard deadlines listed below. It is also possible we will learn some things in the next few weeks that you will have to incorporate into the final project.

## Hard Deadlines 

The following milestones must be completed before the deadline, otherwise the client (The Paint Factory) will risk taking their contract elsewhere!
