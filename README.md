# FSE-Final-Project
Project for Foundations of Software Engineering:
Collaborative Paint - Version 2
The Paint Factory is wanting a desktop application that allows users to collaboratively paint. Something like a Google Docs for folks to collaborate on in real time. As users draw on one application, it should update in real time on all others who have joined. Thus, the application is networked.
The desktop application is programmed in modern C++.
